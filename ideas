need to rewrite solver on string generator
it can be based on vector with available numbers for current point, so
we need to randomly choose between numbers from vec.at(0) to vec.at(vec.size()-1)
from this, we can add a logical condition - if vec is empty, we can't place anything in point
and we need to return to basic field

another idea is to not even try to place numbers in already occupied points (from input field)
